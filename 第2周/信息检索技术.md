What are some interesting and easy to develop personal projects recommended for the theory of the first chapter of the subject Introduction to Information Retrieval

The first chapter of "Introduction to Information Retrieval" provides an overview of the field of Information Retrieval (IR) and introduces key concepts such as ==document representation==, ==query representation==, and ==relevance==. Here are some interesting and easy to develop personal projects related to the first chapter of the subject:

1. <u>**Build a search engine**</u>: You can build a simple search engine that takes a query and returns relevant documents. Start with a small corpus of text documents and implement the Vector Space Model to rank the documents based on their similarity to the query.
2. **<u>Implement a stop word removal</u>**: Implement a stop word removal technique to preprocess documents before they are indexed. Stop words are common words that do not contribute to the meaning of a document, such as "the", "and", "a". Stop word removal helps to reduce the size of the index and improve the performance of the search engine.
3. **<u>Implement a stemming algorithm</u>**: Implement a stemming algorithm to reduce words to their base or root form. For example, "running", "runs", and "run" can be reduced to the root form "run". This helps to **improve the recall of the search engine by matching different forms of the same word**.
4. **<u>Implement a query expansion technique</u>**: Implement a query expansion technique such as the use of a **thesaurus** to expand the query to include synonyms. This helps to improve the precision of the search engine by retrieving documents that contain similar terms to the query.
5. **<u>Build an evaluation framework</u>**: Develop an evaluation framework to measure the effectiveness of your search engine. Use standard evaluation metrics such as ==precision, recall, and F1 score== to compare the performance of your search engine to other search engines or to different configurations of your own search engine.
6. **<u>Build a recommender system</u>**: Build a simple recommender system that recommends items to users based on their preferences. Use techniques such as collaborative filtering or content-based filtering to recommend items to users.
7. **<u>Build a document classification system</u>**: Build a simple document classification system that assigns documents to one or more categories ==based on their content==. Use techniques such as Naive Bayes or Support Vector Machines to classify the documents.

Overall, these are some interesting and easy to develop personal projects that can help you to better understand the concepts of Information Retrieval introduced in the first chapter of the subject.
