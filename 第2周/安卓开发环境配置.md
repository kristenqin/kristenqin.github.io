Sure, here are some beginner projects that can help you practice Java:

1. Simple Calculator: Create a simple calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
2. Guess the Number Game: Develop a program that generates a random number and asks the user to guess the number. The program should keep track of the number of guesses and provide feedback to the user.
3. Hangman Game: Develop a program that prompts the user to guess a word by entering letters one at a time. The program should keep track of the number of incorrect guesses and display a drawing of a hangman as the number of incorrect guesses increases.
4. Tic Tac Toe Game: Create a program that allows two players to play tic tac toe against each other. The program should keep track of the game board and determine when a player has won or when the game is a draw.
5. Address Book: Create a program that allows the user to store and manage contact information. The program should allow the user to add, delete, and update contacts, as well as search for contacts by name.
