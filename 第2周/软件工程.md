Recommend some UML practice problem sets and project platforms

推荐一些UML的练习题集和项目平台

Sure, here are some UML practice problem sets and project platforms you may find useful:

Practice Problem Sets:

1. Object-Oriented Analysis and Design using UML: This is a book written by Simon Bennett, Steve McRobb, and Ray Farmer that contains a variety of UML practice problems and exercises.
2. Visual Paradigm UML Tutorials: Visual Paradigm is a popular UML modeling tool, and they have a set of UML tutorials and practice problems available on their website.
3. Agile Modeling Practice Problems: Agile Modeling is a methodology that emphasizes flexibility and collaboration, and the Agile Modeling website has a set of practice problems that focus on using UML in an agile context.
4. UML Practice Problems from University of Waterloo: This website has a set of UML practice problems that were originally created for a course at the University of Waterloo.

Project Platforms:

1. GitHub: GitHub is a popular platform for hosting and collaborating on software projects, including UML modeling projects. You can create a repository for your UML project and use GitHub's collaboration features to work with other people.
2. Visual Paradigm Online: Visual Paradigm offers an online UML modeling tool that you can use to create and collaborate on UML diagrams. You can also share your diagrams with others and get feedback.
3. Lucidchart: Lucidchart is another online UML modeling tool that offers collaboration features. You can create UML diagrams, share them with others, and work on them together in real-time.
4. StarUML: StarUML is a free UML modeling tool that you can download and use on your own computer. It offers a range of features for creating UML diagrams and exporting them to various formats.





软件工程中详细设计中的结构程序设计是什么, 与编程语言中的程序结构有什么区别, 给出具体案例并分析

What is structural programming in detailed design in software engineering, and what is the difference between it and program structure in programming languages? Give a specific case and analyze it

Structural programming is a programming paradigm that focuses on dividing a program into smaller, more manageable subroutines or functions, with a clear hierarchy and flow of control. It emphasizes on modularizing the code by breaking down the program into smaller subroutines that perform specific tasks, which can be combined together to achieve the desired functionality.

In software engineering, structural programming is used in detailed design to create a program structure that reflects the high-level design, system architecture, and requirements of the software. It involves defining modules, procedures, and functions that encapsulate specific functionality and can be used in different parts of the program, promoting code reusability and maintainability.

On the other hand, program structure in programming languages refers to the syntactical rules and constructs used to define the organization and flow of control in a program. It defines the sequence of instructions to be executed and the relationships between them. Program structure in programming languages is important for understanding the code, debugging, and maintaining it.

For example, let's consider a program that reads a file and performs some operations on its contents. Using structural programming in detailed design, we can divide the program into smaller modules that perform specific tasks, such as reading the file, parsing the contents, processing the data, and generating the output. Each module would be defined as a separate function with clear inputs and outputs, and they can be combined in a specific sequence to achieve the desired functionality.

In programming language terms, the program structure for this example might include loops and conditional statements to read the file and process its contents, variable declarations to store the data, and functions or methods to perform the processing and output generation.

The main difference between structural programming in detailed design and program structure in programming languages is that the former focuses on designing the high-level structure of the software, while the latter defines the low-level syntax and constructs used to implement that structure. Structural programming in detailed design is more concerned with the organization and modularity of the code, while program structure in programming languages is more concerned with the sequence and logic of individual instructions.
