Relay the meaning of the passage to the child “with the conclusion of a burst of activity, the lactic acid level is high in the body fluids, leaving the large animal vulnerable to attack until the acid is reconverted, via oxidative metabolism, by the liver into glucose, which then sent in part back to the muscles for glycogen re-synthesis."

When a large animal does a lot of physical activity, it creates a substance called lactic acid in its body. This substance can make the animal vulnerable to attack by other animals. However, the liver in the animal's body can change the lactic acid back into glucose through a process called oxidative metabolism. This glucose is then sent back to the muscles where it is used to create glycogen, which is important for the animal's muscles to work properly.
