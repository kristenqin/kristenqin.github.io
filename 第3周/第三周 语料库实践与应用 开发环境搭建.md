VScode + 扩展的方式 和直接下载R有什么区别

What is the difference between VScode + extension and direct download of R

VScode is a lightweight and versatile code editor that supports multiple programming languages, including R. The VScode extension for R enables users to perform various tasks within the editor, such as running code, debugging, and accessing the R console.

On the other hand, downloading R directly means installing the R programming language on your computer. Once installed, you can use any text editor to write your R code and then run it in the R environment.

In summary, VScode with the R extension provides a more integrated and streamlined experience for working with R code, while downloading R directly provides more flexibility in terms of choosing your preferred text editor.
