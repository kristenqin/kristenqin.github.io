Online classes began to be popularized just a few decades ago. They are advertised as a way for adults to finish their education and students to learn the material at their own pace—it is far more compatible for people with busy schedules.
But after being enrolled in an online course last fall semester, I came to realize online classes were merely a means to fulfil course requirements.
First of all, students lack the desire to learn, and they simply complete their assignments to receive credit for a passing grade rather than genuinely engage with the course material. As online courses tend to have more than 100 students, most of the assignments are short and simple. They are not designed for students to interact with the material in depth but designed to be graded easily to accommodate such a large number of students.
Perhaps the biggest disadvantage of taking an online class is the absence of face-to-face interaction between the teacher and their students. Live sessions are infrequent and are often scheduled during the middle of the day when students have to attend other classes or work. The office hours of the professor may also be during inconvenient times for many students as well. Most interaction with the professor has to be through email which is often impersonal. It is nearly impossible for students to build a relationship with their professor.
There is also little interaction amongst students. It can be harder for students to create study groups and form relationships with their peers.
Online classes also require either a computer or laptop and a reliable internet connection. Not all students have access to these types of resources, whether it is for financial or other reasons, and some students can be put at a disadvantage.
Offering online classes certainly helps students who would otherwise not be able to attend classroom sessions. However, they fail to provide a genuine education with an emphasis on convenience rather than critical thinking. We need restructured online classes in which students can have a learning experience that will actually provide quality education.

How U.S. schools train students to read What aids are available

In the United States, schools typically use a variety of methods and approaches to teach students how to read. These may include phonics-based instruction, whole language approaches, and a combination of the two.

Phonics-based instruction emphasizes teaching students the relationships between sounds and letters, and how to decode words by sounding out individual letters and blending them together. Whole language approaches, on the other hand, focus on teaching reading through exposure to a wide variety of texts and encouraging students to make meaning from the context.

In recent years, there has been a greater emphasis on evidence-based reading instruction, which draws from both phonics and whole language approaches and emphasizes teaching students the specific skills and knowledge they need to become proficient readers.

In addition to these instructional methods, schools may also make use of a variety of aids and resources to support reading instruction. These can include:

1. Reading programs and curricula: Many schools use specialized reading programs and curricula that are designed to support reading instruction and provide teachers with structured lesson plans and resources.
2. ==Technology-based tools: There are a variety of computer programs and apps that can help students develop their reading skills, including phonics-based games and interactive texts.==
3. Reading interventions: Some schools may provide additional support to struggling readers through targeted interventions, such as small-group instruction or one-on-one tutoring.
4. Literacy coaches and specialists: Many schools employ literacy coaches or reading specialists who work with teachers to improve their instructional practices and provide additional support to struggling readers.
5. Classroom libraries: Providing students with access to a variety of high-quality texts can help to foster a love of reading and support their development as readers.

Overall, the goal of reading instruction in U.S. schools is to help students become proficient readers who can comprehend and analyze a wide variety of texts, and who can use reading as a tool for learning and personal growth.

中国英语学习者应该如何提高自己的英文阅读速度

How Chinese English learners should improve their English reading speed

Improving reading speed in any language requires practice and patience. Here are some tips specifically for Chinese English learners:

1. Read regularly: The more you read, the faster you will become. Try to read every day, even if it is just for a few minutes.
2. Use graded readers: Start with reading materials that are appropriate for your level. Graded readers are books that are written specifically for language learners, with vocabulary and grammar that gradually increase in difficulty.
3. Expand vocabulary: Improve your vocabulary by learning new words every day. Try to learn words in context, so that you can remember them more easily.
4. Skim read: Practice scanning texts quickly to get a general idea of what they are about. This will help you to read more efficiently.
5. Use online tools: There are many online tools available that can help you to improve your reading speed. For example, you can use a speed reading app to practice reading faster.
6. Focus on comprehension: While speed is important, it is also important to understand what you are reading. Make sure you take the time to understand the meaning of the text.
7. Practice with a timer: Set a timer for a short period of time (e.g. 5 minutes) and read as much as you can in that time. Try to increase your reading speed each time you practice.

Remember that improving your reading speed takes time and practice. Don't get discouraged if you don't see immediate results. With consistent effort, you will see improvement over time.
