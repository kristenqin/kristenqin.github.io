```python
# open the file in read mode
with open('file.txt', 'r') as file:
    # read all lines from the file
    lines = file.readlines()

# open the file in write mode
with open('file.txt', 'w') as file:
    # iterate through all lines
    for line in lines:
        # check if the line contains the unwanted pattern
        if '大猩猩' in line:
            # skip this line
            continue
        # write the line to the file
        file.write(line)
```

这段代码太机械了 好多情况感觉都没办法处理

格式化数据的需求

做出一个命令行工具 不需要自己每次都运行脚本了

如果真的做出来了估计就是vim了

solve it "FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'file.txt'
```

This error occurs when you try to access a file that does not exist in the specified path or directory. There could be several reasons why this error is happening, such as:

1. The file name or path is misspelled.
2. The file has been moved, renamed or deleted.
3. The program is running in a different directory than where the file is located.

To solve this error, you can try the following:

1. Double-check the file name and path to ensure they are correct.
2. Check if the file exists in the specified directory.
3. If the file has been moved, renamed or deleted, make sure to update the program with the correct file name and path.
4. If the program is running in a different directory, you can either move the file to the current directory or update the file path to include the correct directory.

It's important to note that this error can also occur if you don't have the necessary permissions to access the file or directory. In this case, you may need to change the permissions or run the program with elevated privileges.
