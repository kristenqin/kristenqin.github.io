目的是给用户提供更适合自己的笔记工具



To compare note-taking software, we can consider several factors such as the features offered, platform compatibility, pricing, collaboration capabilities, and user interface. Below is a table comparing some of the popular note-taking software available in the market:

| Software    | Features                                                     | Platform Compatibility          | Pricing                                                   | Collaboration | User Interface               |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Evernote    | Note-taking, Web clipping, Tagging, OCR, Reminders, Templates, Integration with other apps | Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, Web | Free, Premium ($7.99/month), Business ($14.99/user/month) | Yes           | Simple, clean, easy-to-use   |
| OneNote     | Note-taking, Web clipping, Tagging, OCR, Audio recording, Drawing tools, Integration with other apps | Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, Web | Free                                                      | Yes           | Organized, user-friendly     |
| Google Keep | Note-taking, Voice notes, Checklists, Image recognition, Integration with other apps | Web, Android, iOS               | Free                                                      | Yes           | Colorful, visually appealing |
| Apple Notes | Note-taking, Sketching, Web clipping, Checklists, Integration with other apps | Mac, iOS                        | Free                                                      | Yes           | Clean, minimalist            |
| Simplenote  | Note-taking, Tagging, Syncing, Collaboration, Markdown support | Web, Windows, Mac, iOS, Android | Free                                                      | Yes           | Simple, text-focused         |

Based on this table, we can generate a user requirement description for note-taking software as follows:

1. Platform compatibility: The software must be compatible with my preferred device (e.g., Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, or web-based).
2. Features: The software should offer features such as note-taking, web clipping, tagging, OCR, checklists, and integration with other apps.
3. Collaboration: The software must allow collaboration with other users.
4. User interface: The software should have a clean, user-friendly interface that makes it easy to organize and access notes.

To create a survey to help users select the best note-taking software based on their needs, we can ask the following questions:

1. What platform do you primarily use for note-taking? (Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, or web-based)
2. What features do you require in your note-taking software? (Note-taking, web clipping, tagging, OCR, checklists, audio recording, drawing tools, or other)
3. Do you need to collaborate with other users on your notes? (Yes or No)
4. How important is the user interface to you? (Very important, somewhat important, not very important, or not important at all)

Based on the responses, we can score each software based on how well it meets the user's requirements. For example, if a user primarily uses Windows, requires web clipping and tagging, needs collaboration, and values a clean user interface, Evernote may be the best choice, as it scores high on all of these factors. Alternatively, if a user primarily uses Mac, requires sketching and web clipping, and values a minimalist user interface, Apple Notes may be the best choice, as it scores high on these factors.

Based on the above table, we can create a user requirement description and survey questions.

**User Requirement Description:**

The user is looking for a note-taking software that:

- Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- Provides a free plan or affordable pricing for advanced features
- Supports both Markdown and WYSIWYG editing
- Has a graph view, bi-directional linking, tags, and backlinks
- Offers encryption for sensitive notes
- Supports collaboration with others.

**Survey Questions:**

1. What platforms do you use for note-taking software? (Windows, macOS, Linux, Web)
2. How important is it for you to have a free plan or affordable pricing for advanced features?
3. Do you prefer to use Markdown, WYSIWYG, or both?
4. How important is it for you to have a graph view, bi-directional linking, tags, and backlinks?
5. Do you need encryption for your sensitive notes?
6. Do you collaborate with others on your notes?
7. If yes, how important is collaboration for you?
8. Do you have any additional requirements or preferences?

**Note-taking Software Selection:**

Based on the survey responses, we can use the following score ranges to determine the note-taking software that best meets the user's needs:

- 0-3: Not recommended
- 4-6: Good fit
- 7-8: Best fit

We can assign a score to each software based on the user's responses and their feature availability. For example, if a user prioritizes collaboration, they would assign a higher score to software that offers collaboration features. After all scores have been assigned, we can recommend the software with the highest score as the best fit for the user's needs.



What are the tools that assist users in clarifying their own needs?

There are various tools that can help users clarify their needs, depending on the context and purpose. Here are some examples:

1. ==User surveys or questionnaires==: These tools allow users to provide feedback on their preferences and needs, which can help businesses or organizations better understand their audience and tailor their products or services accordingly.
2. ==Customer support==: Many companies offer customer support channels, such as email or live chat, which allow users to ask questions and receive personalized guidance in clarifying their needs.
3. ==User personas==: User personas are fictional representations of typical users that can help designers and developers understand user needs and preferences in order to create products that meet those needs.
4. ==User testing==: User testing involves observing users interacting with a product or service in order to identify pain points or areas for improvement, which can help clarify user needs.
5. ==Prototyping==: Prototyping involves creating a mockup or model of a product or service in order to test and refine its features and functionality based on user feedback, which can help clarify user needs and preferences.
