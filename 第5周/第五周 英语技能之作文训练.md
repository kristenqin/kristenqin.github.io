However, after the construction, two-thirds of the island has been equipped with various facilities for the convenience of tourists.

In the center of the island, there is a reception and a restaurant that are linked by a vehicle track. The surrounding area comprises accommodations that are connected by footpaths, while the coconut trees have been preserved instead of being cut down. Moreover, the island boasts additional facilities that cater to the tourists' needs, such as a swimming area adjacent to the beach, and a pier that connects the vehicle track and sailboats.

Overall, it is clear that the development has significantly transformed the island by providing tourists with essential amenities that enhance their experience. The preservation of the coconut trees further adds to the island's natural beauty. Therefore, the development of tourist facilities on the island can be viewed as a positive step towards promoting tourism in the area.

can you give me more details about my essay writing errors





Certainly, I can provide you with more information about the errors in your essay. Here are some examples:

1. Lexical Resource:

- "few coconut trees on it" could be improved to "sparse vegetation" or "scanty foliage".
- "constructed with useful amenities" could be improved to "equipped with useful facilities".
- "Around them are accommodations" could be improved to "The surrounding area comprises of accommodations".

1. Grammatical Range and Accuracy:

- "two thirds of the island had been constructed with useful amenities" - the tense should be consistent, so "has been constructed" would be more appropriate.
- "After construction, two-thirds of the island has been equipped with various facilities for the convenience of tourists" - "two-thirds" is plural, so it should be "have been equipped".
- "Also, coconut trees are kept instead of being cut down" - "are kept" is in the passive voice, so it would be more appropriate to use active voice: "We preserved the coconut trees instead of cutting them down".
- "There are swimming area next to the beach" - "swimming area" should be singular: "There is a swimming area next to the beach".

In general, it's a good idea to vary your sentence structures and use a mix of simple, compound, and complex sentences. Additionally, try to use a range of verb tenses and pay attention to subject-verb agreement. Finally, make sure to proofread your work carefully for errors in grammar, vocabulary, and spelling.
